# Notes Assistant
An assistant built with Dify(https://dify.ai) that helps students like us extract knowledge from handwritten notes, while also correcting error if any. It is ideal for notes cleanup, study summarization, content reviewing and so on.

# Features 
Extract key points and summaries from messy, mixed with handwitten notes and pictures.
Automatically detect and correct errors in grammar and logic.
Suitable for study reviews, knowledge consolidation, and editing.
Built using Dify with a customizable prompt and qwen llm backend.

# How it works
This assistant uses a custom YAML configuration in Dify, which defines its role, style, and instructions. You can modify the behavior by editing the prompt or system messages.

The core logic is simple:

1. You upload your note (or paste it as plain text)
2. The assistant analyzes it line by line
3. It returns a cleaned, corrected version, with possible summaries
